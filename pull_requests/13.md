### Notes for Maintainers
I cannot perform the rebase and force-push from here, but here are exact commands you can run locally to rebase the branch onto main, prefer the PR branch changes for any conflicts, and push the resolved branch back to GitHub:

1) Fetch and check out the PR branch:

   git fetch origin
   git checkout claude/session-011CUZWjQwnZ5N9eDhz4cfmC

2) Rebase onto main, preferring the PR branch changes if conflicts occur (linear history):

   git fetch origin
   git rebase -s recursive -X ours origin/main

   - If the rebase stops with conflicts, resolve them by running:
       git ls-files -u | awk '{print $4}' | sort -u
     Then for each listed file:
       git checkout --ours -- <path/to/file>
       git add <path/to/file>
     After resolving all files:
       git rebase --continue

   - If you need to abort the rebase:
       git rebase --abort

3) When the rebase completes successfully, force-push the branch back to GitHub with lease:

   git push --force-with-lease origin claude/session-011CUZWjQwnZ5N9eDhz4cfmC

### Additional Notes:
- This rebase strategy (-X ours) will prefer the PR branch changes when automatic merges are performed. Manual resolution steps above ensure any remaining conflicts keep the PR branch version.
- Run your project's tests and linters locally before pushing (e.g., npm ci && npm test && npm run lint) and fix any issues found.

If you'd like, I can also update the PR description to a cleaner summary after you push the rebased branch. Let me know and I will update the PR description/comment accordingly.
