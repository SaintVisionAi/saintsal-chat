# ⚡ QUICK START - Fix Your Database NOW

## 🔴 Current Status: Database is EMPTY (0 collections)

## ✅ 3-Step Fix (5 minutes)

### STEP 1: Open MongoDB Atlas
1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Click your project
3. Go to **Security → Network Access**
4. Click **"Add IP Address"**
5. Select **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (add 0.0.0.0/0)
6. Click **Confirm**
7. ⏰ **WAIT 2 MINUTES** for it to take effect

### STEP 2: Run the Setup Command
In your terminal (from this project folder):
```bash
npm run db:setup
```

### STEP 3: Verify It Worked
You should see:
```
✅ CONNECTION SUCCESSFUL!
✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED!
🚀 Your application is ready to use!
```

## 🎯 That's It!

Your database now has:
- ✅ 6 collections (users, pricing, messages, documents, teams, team_invitations)
- ✅ 15+ indexes for performance
- ✅ 3 pricing tiers (free, pro, enterprise)

## 🚀 Start Your App
```bash
npm run dev
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 and sign up!

## ❌ If STEP 2 Fails

Run these one at a time to find the issue:

```bash
# Test connection
npm run db:check

# If that works, create collections
npm run db:init

# Verify everything
npm run db:verify
```

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Can't connect?**
   - Did you wait 2 minutes after adding the IP?
   - Try removing and re-adding 0.0.0.0/0 in Network Access

2. **Authentication error?**
   - Check `.env.local` line 57 has correct MongoDB credentials

3. **Script not found?**
   - Make sure you're in the `/home/user/saintsal-chat` directory
   - Run `npm install` first
